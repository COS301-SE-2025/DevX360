   ```bash
   cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/config.json
   ```

### If Tools Timeout:
- The GitHub API calls can take time for large repositories
- This is normal behavior - the tools are working but may need patience for complex analyses

- These don't affect functionality but indicate some API endpoints will be updated
- Your GitHub tokens are properly configured

## üéØ Usage Examples

### DevOps Assessment
```
"Assess the DevOps maturity of https://github.com/owner/repo by analyzing their DORA metrics and providing improvement recommendations"
```

### Team Analysis
```
"Analyze the development team structure and performance for https://github.com/owner/repo"
```

### Repository Health Check
```
"Perform a comprehensive health check of https://github.com/owner/repo including code quality, deployment patterns, and team collaboration"
```

## üìä Expected Output Format

The tools will provide structured analysis including:
- **DORA Metrics**: Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, change failure rate
- **Trends**: Performance improvements or declines over time
- **Insights**: AI-generated recommendations and observations
- **Repository Stats**: Language distribution, contributor activity, project health

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Environment Variables
If you need to modify the MCP server environment, update the config.json:
